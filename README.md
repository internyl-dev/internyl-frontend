## Overview
Finding internships online for high school students and undergraduates is messy and convoluted. With the limited tools available now, and the independence of many organizations that offer internships, it's reasonable to say that searching for and organizing internships is still in its primitive age. 
<br>
<br>
Internyl aims to fix these issues by creating a central website displaying currently available internships taken from the internet in real time. Each internship opportunity is tagged with essential attributes like cost, eligibility, deadlines, and much more to easily filter opportunities based on your preference.
<br>
<br>
By creating an account, you'll be able to keep track of the internships you applied to all in one place including when results come out.
